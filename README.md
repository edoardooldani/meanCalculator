# Credit Weighted Average Calculator
This is a small python script to calculate the weighted university average on credits, there is also a function that allows you to calculate the most penalizing exam and remove it, recalculating the average.

To make this script work, simply create a folder in which all the exams passed are present in the format:
exam (vote) (credits)

Without one of the 3 parameters the script will go to the next line, this is because some exams have no grade.
